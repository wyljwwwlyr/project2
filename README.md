Just run the program with two file which contains the number that you want to take into calculation
With this code;
You can get the result of adding two polynomials(such as text1, text2);
For example:
1x^4+2x^3+3x^2+4x+5
and
3x^2+2x+1
You can store the number and values of coefficient in two files, which will be 5 1 2 3 4 5 and 3 3 2 1.
The first number is the numbers of coefficient.
Then you will get 5 1 2 6 6 6.
I learned a lot of how to read and write in files from doing this project.
